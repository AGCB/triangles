Triangles w/ Inverted Triangles
=======
Learning to program, I come across some things that are such a head-flip it's hilarious.
I came across [`this`](http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/ ) and it sparked in my head to try setting up triangles inside other triangles. What I found after a bit of googling was, well, hilarious!
Instead of my assumption which might be something along the lines of...
.divSelector {shape: triangle;}
instead what I found was...
 * make a rectangle
 * give it borders
 * make the box transparent
 * make the box height and width size 0
 * make all borders transparent except for 1
 now you have a triangle!

 Wow.
